## Abstract

## Acknowledgements

This research is a collaboration between myself and N. Mak without whom the experiment would not have been effectively completed  to as high a level of accuracy nor within reasonable time restraints. With aid from those at the MPhys Physics Laboratory for the use of equipment as well as the staff that ensure all of the equipment is maintained and functional throughout the process of the experiment.

 We gratefully acknowledge the support of Dr. F. Orucevic who was the laboratory supervisor for this experiment providing insight and guidance throughout the experimental procedure.
