# Saturated Laser Spectroscopy

## Abstract

Observing the hyperfine transitions probes the finest details of atomic structure which allows the investigation ofphysics on minute scales. Here we use a saturated laser absorption spectroscopy set up to identify, model and quantify the lorentzian curve profiles of the hyperfine transitions in natural rubidium including crossover resonances as well as a calibration of the Fabry-Perot interferometer. This measurement is attained by method of gradual ramping of voltage input into the laser diode to vary the frequency over time, this produces a spectrograph in the order of megaHertz which can be fitted to evaluate the different parameters of these curve profiles.
The process resulted in four hyperfine fits with accurate measurements of relative frequencies, each fit had an average error in the order of μV.  The measurements of the Doppler broadened spectrum produced an expected ∆νFSR which deviated from the given value by 8.348±0.047% indicating that there could be some deviation from the expected behaviour that is not accounted for in this measurement.
